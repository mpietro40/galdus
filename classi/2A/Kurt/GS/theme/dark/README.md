The original Template has been made by Tristar Web Design (http://www.tristarwebdesign.co.uk) and fully integrated with GetSimple 
by Artur Główczyński aka Artix (www.artglow.me). 
Further modifications including the proper integration of the "Child Menu" and the "i18n" plugin for GetSimple plus several design changes
have been made by Manuel Kehl aka mank319 (manuel-kehl.de).
We would be grateful if you leave the credit links in footer of the template.php file.

-------------------------
Just upload all files from the archive to the "theme" dir at your server. Next go to the admin page of your GetSimple site 
and activate the theme via the "Theme" tab.
If you have command line access to your webserver and like working in a shell, you may consider automating the 
install process with https://github.com/mank319/gscmsh.
