									<ul>
<li><p class="paragraph3" style="line-height:1.0em;">1. Change your passwords on any and all websites that contain sensitive data. But, before you do, check if the websites have been upgraded to patch the problem. If you change your password and the website has not been patched against Heartbleed, then you are potentially giving a hacker your new password. You will also want to make sure that the website has renewed its private encryption key. There is no easy checker for this yet but you could always ask representatives for the company if they have updated their keys.</li>
<li><p class="paragraph3" style="line-height:1.0em;">2. Monitor your credit card and bank activity and report suspicious charges.</li>
<li><p class="paragraph3" style="line-height:1.0em;">3. Contact website owners to make sure they have patched and tested their servers.</li>
<li><p class="paragraph3" style="line-height:1.0em;">4. Web anonymisation software Tor has said that people should probably hop off the internet for a couple of days while big and small websites work to patch their servers against the flaw. Tor said if people valued their privacy, this was probably the best option for the time being. Many people, however, require the internet to do their job, so this is not very practical. </li></p>

<p class="paragraph2" style="line-height:1.0em;"><span style="color: red;">If you are a developer, system administrator or businesses owner with a website that uses encryption (that little padlock icon in a web browser), you need to check whether your website's server is affected and patch it:</p><br><br></span>
<li><p class="paragraph3" style="line-height:1.0em;">1. Update OpenSSL to a version without the vulnerability. Check heartbleed.com for a list of OpenSSL versions affected and not affected and test again after any update.</li>
<li><p class="paragraph3" style="line-height:1.0em;">2. Reissue and reinstall SSL certificates on affected servers (the private keys). If your server was vulnerable, your private keys may have been compromised. Those keys could be used to decrypt any data your customers send to your website through SSL. You need to create a new key and request a new SSL certificate from your vendor and install it on your server. Many certificate providers appear to be doing this for no cost but some are charging.</li>
<li><p class="paragraph3" style="line-height:1.0em;">3. Contact customers and request that they reset their passwords. Yes, this is awkward but it is probably the best course of action to take to protect your reputation and their security.</li>
