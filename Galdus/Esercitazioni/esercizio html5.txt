Webville Guide to HTML
In this handy glide, we've boiled down writing well-formed HTML pages
into a common sense set of guidelines. Check them out

1) Always begin with the <!doctype>.
Always start each page with a doctype. This will
get you off on the right foot with browsers, and
with the validator too.
Use <!docytype> at all times, unless
you really are writing HTML 4.01 or XHTML

2) The <html> element: don't leave home without it.
Following the doctype, the <thml> element must
always be the top, or root, element of your web
page. So, after the doctype,the <html> tag will
start your page and the </html> tag should end it,
with everything else in you page nested inside.

3) Remember to use both your <head> and your
<body> for better HTML.
Only the <head> and <body> elements can go
directly inside your <html> element. This means
that every other element must go either inside the
<head> or the <body> element. No exceptions!

4) Feed you <head> the right character encoding.
Include a <meta charset="utf-8"> tag in your
<head>. The browser will thank you, and so will
your users when they're reading comments on your
blog from users around the world.

Webville Guide to HTML, continued
In this handy guide, we’ve boiled down writing well-fonned HTML pages
into a common sense set of guideines. Check them out:

5) What’s a <head> without a <title>?
Always give your <head> element a <title>
element. It's the law. Failure to do so will result in
HTML that isn’t compliant. The <head> element
is the only place you should put your <title>,
<meta>, and <style> elements.

6) Be careful about nesting certain elements.
Within the guidelines we've provided here, the
nesting rules are fairly fexible. But there are a couple
of cases that don‘t make sense. Never nest an <a>
element inside another <a> element because that
would be too confusing for our visitors. Also, void
elements lite <img> provide no way to nest other
inline elements within them.

7) Check your attributes!
Some element attributes are required, and some are
optional. For instance, the <img> element wouldn't
make much sense without a src attribute and now
you know the alt attrihute is required too. Get familiar
with the required and optional attributes of each
element as you learn it.
